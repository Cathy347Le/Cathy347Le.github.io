        <h1>Hello, my name is Cathy Le.</h1>
        <p>
          I am a full stack software engineer, formerly a political research
          data analyst at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a political polling and
          consulting firm. As a Software Engineer, I enjoying breaking down
          complex problems into simple, user-friendly solutions. I’m not afraid
          to get my hands dirty, break my code, and build it back up again. You
          can take a look at my latest work on the projects page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to the tech industry, the polling industry is a very
          collaborative environment. I take pride in knowing how to work with
          people of different skillsets, personality, and background to
          accomplish the task at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my free time, I enjoy hosting dinner parties with my boyfriend
          George, and spending time with my labradoodle name Gouda. When I’m not
          coding, I’m probably out with Gouda, either taking her for a walk or
          playing fetch.
